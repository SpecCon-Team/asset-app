## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### No notification received?

**Check 1: User is marked as WhatsApp user**
```bash
node checkUsers.mjs
# Look for isWhatsAppUser: true
```

**Check 2: Notifications enabled**
```bash
# Check user.whatsAppNotifications = true
```

**Check 3: Phone number exists**
```bash
# User must have valid phone number
```

**Check 4: Server logs**
```bash
# Look for:
# ❌ Any errors about WhatsApp sending
# ✅ "📱 Sending WhatsApp notification..."
# ✅ "✅ WhatsApp notification sent..."
```

**Check 5: Access token valid**
```bash
# If token expired, notifications will fail
# Check server logs for "Session has expired" errors
```

---

## 💡 Quick Fixes

### Update existing users:
```bash
node markWhatsAppUsers.mjs
```

### Manually enable notifications for a user:
```sql
UPDATE "User"
SET "whatsAppNotifications" = true
WHERE "phone" = '27606344230';
```

### Check notification settings:
```bash
node -e "
import('./src/lib/prisma.js').then(async ({ prisma }) => {
  const user = await prisma.user.findFirst({
    where: { phone: { contains: '606344230' } },
    select: { name: true, isWhatsAppUser: true, whatsAppNotifications: true }
  });
  console.log(user);
  process.exit(0);
});
"
```
